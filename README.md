twitter-api-proxy
=================

A local proxy to use when building services against the twitter api

The throttling is driving me crazy when trying to iterate quickly against the api. This proxy will cache results locally for a configurable amount of time before going back to Twitter for new results.

This is specific to one of my projects so it may not be the right solution for you.

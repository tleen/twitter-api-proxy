twitter-api-proxy
=================

A local proxy to use when building services against the twitter api. 

This is a developer tool: the throttling is driving me crazy when trying to iterate quickly against the api. This proxy will cache results locally for a configurable amount of time before going back to Twitter for new results. For now I only plan on implementing the calls I am using in one of my projects.

This is specific to one of my projects so it may not be the right solution for you.
